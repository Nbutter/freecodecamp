## Free Code Camp
Code for [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) projects.

Free Code Camp is a very cool effort to replicate the curriculum of a paid bootcamp for free, while offering those who complete the basic assignments a chance to work on collaborative teams doing web development for non-profits in order to build their portfolios.

June 2015: Having worked my way through most of FCC's "Bonfires" and "Waypoints" I'm starting their "Ziplines" (and, one hopes, "Basejumps"), hoping to complete them all and begin work on a non-profit by then.
